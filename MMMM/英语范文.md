To Whom It May Concern,

As a student of our university, I should first appreciate you installing additional computers in the computer rooms.
However, I am writing to you to request that the Internet also be installed in the students' dormitories.

As you know, the Internet has become an increasingly important tool for students at university.
Not only do professors require us to use it for research, but much of the communication between professors and students is done through email as well.
In addition, some professors are beginning to post their lecture notes online for students to review in their spare time.

While there are a few computer labs with Internet access throughout our campus, with over 20,000 students living in the dormitories, there is a great need for more In ternet-accessible areas.

Thank you for your time.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

Dear Friends,

I am writing the email to introduce one of the most prestigious Chinese ce le brities to you, Confucius.

Being a great thinker, educator and founder of Confucianism, Confucius is an ancient sage during the Spring and Autumn Period.
His words and life story were recorded by his disciples and their students in The Analects.
As an enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture, The Analects has influenced all thinkers, writers and politicians in the over-2000- year-long history of China after Confucius.
No scholar could truly understand this long-standing culture or the inner world of the ancient Chinese without this book.

Much of Confucian thought on Heaven and people represents universal human values.
This is perhaps why Confucian thought in the 21 st century still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also in other parts of the world.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to thank you for arranging to meet with me for an interview at 10:00 a.m. on Monday, December 25, 2017.

Unfortunately, I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require surgery on the same day as our interview.
I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the interview.
If possible, I would like to postpone the interview to another day later in the week.
I promise that such a situation does not usually happen, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

I am looking forward to hearing from youand, again, am sorry for any trouble this may have caused.
Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a regular passenger of your train, I am severely disappointed to find that the service you have recently provided is far from satisfactory.
Therefore, l am writing this letter to draw your attention to the ma tter in the hope that the present situation can be improved.

As we all know, punctuality is essential to the railway service.
However, the train has been delayed from time to time, which has brought me much trouble and inconvenience.
Even worse are the bad manners of your stewards and stewardesses.
Their service has not benefited from the saying, "The customer is king."

I believe you will take this matter into serious consideration and give a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. At the same time, I sincerely hope that you will review your management system.
I would be glad to see improvements in your railway service.

Yours truly,
Li Ming
